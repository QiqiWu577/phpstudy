[PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), **Hypertext Preprocessor**, is the popular server scripting language designed for web development. The main reason why I want to talk about PHP in this blog is that It has been a long time that learning PHP exists in my to-do list but just do not have sufficient time to do some research about it. Recently, I got a interview chance last week and the potential company asked me to solve the PHP problem. After I completed the task, I am so impressed about the efficiency of this programming language because the simple syntax and the a variaty of useful functions of its liabray. From my opinoin, It is really worthy here to share what handy knowledge of PHP I have learned.
