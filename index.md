[PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), **Hypertext Preprocessor**, is the popular server scripting language designed for web development. The main reason why I want to talk about PHP in this blog is that It has been a long time that learning PHP exists in my to-do list but just do not have sufficient time to do some research about it. Recently, I got a interview chance last week and the potential company asked me to solve the PHP problem. After I completed the task, I am so impressed about the efficiency of this programming language because the simple syntax and the a variaty of useful functions of its liabray. From my opinoin, It is really worthy here to share what handy knowledge of PHP I have learned.

Another thing I want to mention before we start to explore is that the compiler I use. Since I have to finish the task in the limited time, I did not loading my php file in the [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). What I use is the [online sandbox PHP](http://sandbox.onlinephpfunctions.com/), which I found it is very useful and easy to use to test the output of the codes. In this blog, I would use the output that sanbox PHP compiles.
